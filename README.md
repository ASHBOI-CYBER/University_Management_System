This University Management System is a C++ console application designed to manage various aspects of a university. It leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to provide a structured, modular, and easily maintainable codebase. The system includes functionality to manage students, faculty, courses, and examinations.

Faculty Management: Add, delete, update, and view faculty information.
Course Management: Add, delete, update, and view course information.
Enrollment Management: Enroll students in courses and manage enrollments.
Examination Management: Schedule exams, manage exam timings, and handle exam questions.
OOP Concepts Implemented
Classes and Objects: Core entities such as Student, Faculty, Course, and Exam are represented as classes.
Inheritance: Demonstrates the relationship between base classes and derived classes.
Polymorphism: Uses both compile-time (function overloading) and run-time polymorphism (virtual functions).
Encapsulation: Data members are private, with public getters and setters to access and modify them.
Abstraction: Provides abstract classes and interfaces to define common interfaces for derived classes.
